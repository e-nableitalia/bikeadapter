## bikeadapter
A bike adapter device for children with limb difference problems, configurable to be adapted to the user, can be entirely build with a 3d printer using a flexible filament

## Description
After several iteraction the e-Nable Italia's team composed by Alessandro and Michele has released the first prototype of a hand device called "Bike Adapter".
This device was designed to help children and adults with limb difference problems (amputations or agenesys of hand/arm) to easly connect with the bicycle handlebar allowing a better control of the bike direction.
The Bike Adapter was entirely designed with Autodesk Fusion360 and can be customized setting the approriate values in the available parameters allowing the generation of a 3d model adapted to the end user and thus STL or 3MF files for the slicer/3d printer.
The device is printed with flexible filament (TPU) to obtain the perfect mix between comfort, safety and functionality.
The project is open source, e-Nable Italia's volunteers provide the Bike Adapter device (and others) free of charge for anyone is in need of such assistive devices.

## Dimensioning
Dimensioning is done by setting appropriate values in parameters exposed in the Autodesk Fusion360 project.
After opening the project in Autodesk Fusion360 go to "Modify" menu and select "fx Change Parameters" menu entry.
Insert the appropriate values in the parameters in sequence:
* A_lng_unaff, length of unaffected arm
* B_lng_affect, length of affected arm
* C_tip_circ, circumference length, measured approximately 2 cm below the tip of the stump
* D_root_circ, circumference length, measured at the elbow crease
* vent_hole_no, number of vent holes, take care to choose an appropriate value to keep holes below the solid body of the device
* E_handle_dia, bike handlebar diameter
* F_lng_affect_inner_elbow, length of affected arm, measured from elbow crease to the tip of the stump
